# Inc_5000

Using Maven Analytics dataset focused on the 2019 Inc. 5000 Companies in the United States, I created a project to visualize the insights and information gained from my analysis. 
The Inc. 5000 list serves as a ranking list for privately held companies, evaluating their overall revenue growth over the course of three years. 
I used SQL to write queries specific to the questions I wanted to answer regarding the dataset. Functions such as ROUND and AVG were often used, as well as the CEILING function to round the percentage up to the nearest whole number. 
Additionally, by using the DESC ordering instead of the default ASC, I captured a view of highest to lowest averages.
